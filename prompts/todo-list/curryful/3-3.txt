I have provide you with:
- The curryful-commons library, which curryful-rest builds upon
- The curryful-rest library, which is a simple rest framework,
  leaving out the utility classes Http and Uri, you don't need
  to know about those
- An example application using curryful-rest

The framework utilizes the concepts of functional programming,
so use functional programming principles you know about as wel as
the principles already applied in the example code.

I want you to write a simple rest api for a todo list.
The todo list should be stored in memory and should be accessible
through the following endpoints:

- GET /todos
- POST /todos
- GET /todos/:id
- PUT /todos/:id
- DELETE /todos/:id
- POST /todos/:id/toggle

A todo is described by the following json object:
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Buy milk",
  "completed": false
}

As you can see, the framework does not handle json on its own. Please
use jackson to parse json to objects and objects to json.
